# Philadelphia Eagles Player Hometowns Map

This interactive web application visualizes the hometowns of every player on the 2024â€“2025 Philadelphia Eagles roster using Leaflet.js, Bootstrap, and GeoJSON. Users can explore player origins by clicking on each marker to view a popup with details such as name, age, college, and hometown. The map provides insight into the geographic diversity of the team, highlighting which cities and regions have produced current NFL players.

The project integrates spatial clustering to reduce visual overlap for players from the same area and includes a header image, project description, and a visual photo collage from recent Super Bowl moments. It was designed to provide an engaging way to connect geographic data with sports analytics in a web-based environment.

This application was inspired by an article published by *USA Today* which featured an interactive hometown map of the Chiefs and Eagles Super Bowl rosters. The data and concept were based on the following source:

I decided as a whole to only highlight Eagles players over Chiefs players because the Philadelphia Eagles are my favorite team since I was 8.
